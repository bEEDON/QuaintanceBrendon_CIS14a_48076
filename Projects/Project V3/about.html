            Hello my name is bEEDON and I currently reside in the Inland Empire in Southern California. 
            I have been DJing since 2009 and my love for music started around age 10, when I began to learn 
            how to play percussion in elementary school. Soon after that, I began to self-teach myself and 
            learn how to shred on the drums and guitar and rocked out in garages and bedrooms. It was not soon 
            after that until I started twisting knobs, controlling faders, and dropping the Bass as I learned 
            to DJ while exiting high school.
            <br /><br />
            With previous knowledge of music, beat counting, and rhythm, DJing came a lot easier to me. I quickly learned 
            to mix different music genres from Electronic, to Hip Hop, to Spanish Music, to various Old school 
            generes. However, my passion for mixing resides in Electronic Music because my ears crave bass to survive. 
            I began to buy necessary gear with money saved up from crappy part-time jobs to get me to where I am today. 
            I currently work a part-time job and go to full-time college  for Business and Computers. Nonetheless, I plan 
            to spin records until I am in a wheel chair and keep the bass flowing!
